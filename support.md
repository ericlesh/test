1. For troubleshooting customers like CIT that are using their company ID verification and Single-Sign On (SSO) to access ActiveDisclosure, the only setting that needs to be checked and potentially updated is &#39;Username&#39; in the &#39;Account User&#39; section of the Admin Console.  If the &#39;Username&#39; matches the &#39;Contact Email&#39; then there is nothing else we can to do on our side.  Any customer who still has login difficulties should then talk with their company admin or IT staff to see if they have the correct permissions to access ActiveDisclosure within their corporate domain.
2. To verify &#39;Username&#39; equals &#39;Contact email&#39; for users, open the CLAMP site and log in with your AD3 credentials.

8. To edit, click the three dots at the right edge of the user line, then click &quot;Edit&quot; in the drop-down box.
9. Edit the users &#39;Username&#39; to match &#39;Contact email&#39; like this:<br>
